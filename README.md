# learnPythonAndR
beginner tutorial to learn Python and R side by side

I first started learning R for an assigned research project. Soon, I was pointed at the Python direction because there is no equivalent package in R for my assignment. So I was forced to learn R and Python at the same time. I created this project to put both programming languages side by side and demonstrate how you can learn by compare and contrast. 

I used both languages to conduct data analysis and visualization. This is where I am going to focus on:
    1) key data types
    2) programing structure
    3) data transformation
    4) file IO
    5) data visualization
    6) statistics analysis
